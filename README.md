# front-end-capstone
An app that allows the user to upload images to be used as Zoom backgrounds. Images are uploaded by the user and can be saved in default folders or user can create custom folders instead. The user will have the abilty to create, edit and delete both images and folders. There will also be a photo editor so the user can use filter effects and markup on their uploaded images.
